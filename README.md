# SPG-Project-3D

This project is inspired by the [Coding Adventure Boids video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw).

The program is a simulation of the flocking behaviour of birds in a 3D space acording to the information 
in [Craig W. Reynolds paper](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/).

In order to run the code on your machine, you must download the [Computer Graphic Elements Course Framework](https://github.com/UPB-Graphics/Framework-EGC) and append this repository to the Visual Studio project.
